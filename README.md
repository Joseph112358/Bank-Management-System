# Bank-Management-System

<p>This is a simple bank management system program I created to test my C++ knowledge and to improve my overall software developer ability (System design, documentation, testing approach, etc etc). It's not intended to be particularly original or creative, just to demonstrate fundamental competencies. </p>
